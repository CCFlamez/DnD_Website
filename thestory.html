        <h2>So where we did this all begin?.</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>Origin Story...</h3>
        <p>
            In the beginning, a handsome, devilish bard by the name of <a href="characters.html#risiko" class="clean">Risiko</a> was just sat at a table in the local tavern of Eelry, minding his own business, before a large, hulking brute of a Dragonborn decided to sit down and play some dice games, who's name was <a href="characters.html#hesk" class="clean">Heskan Norixius</a>.
            Within the same moment, a knight in full armour, by the name of <a href="characters.html#don" class="clean">Don Lampino La Carmona</a>, came crashing through the door, knocking over one of the patrons.
            This was the blue haired Moon Elf, <a href="characters.html#ara" class="clean">Ara</a>, and shortly after this calamity of events the tavern was raided by monsters.
            As the patrons rushed to the exits, these four stayed behind to protect the innocents.
            They showed a mutual connection to eachother as defenders of the people, and as such decided to stick together and figure out who caused this attack.
            The first of many encounters to come, this was the origin of the party that would later become the Fast and the Furrious.
        </p>

    <br>
    <div class="textF">
        <h3>What have they done?</h3>
        <p>
            Once the party had dealt with this, they moved on from the small town of Eelry, and pursued the nearby city of Crius, which appeared to be under attack by zombies.
            This scourge led them to Gilthunder, a member of Crius's guard, who welcomed the adventurers in for assistance with their undead problems.
            While looking around the safer areas of the city, they stumbled upon a merchant who was selling coloured bottles of water as potions, which <a href="characters.html#don" class="clean">Don</a> easily fell for.
            When the center of the cities safe zones became under attack, the Tabaxi merchant known as <a href="characters.html#canvas" class="clean">Canvas</a> stayed and fought, enabling him to join the party.
            The 5 of them in tow headed underneath the city, into the sewer system, where they encountered a zombified beholder and many undead creatures, along with a Jackal like figure who caused it all.
            They were able to vanquish the monsters, but the Jackal like figure escaped, this ended the scourge of undead but the threat of action remained.
        </p>
        <p>
            While venturing around for ways to find the Jackal-man, <a href="characters.html#hesk" class="clean">Hesk</a> was awoken by a thief leaving his bedroom window clasping his coin purse. He chased the figure down but was too slow to catch them, so he threw a javelin at their leg instead, to enact justice of law.
            Once they were caught, an apology was had and a settlement was reached, this thief, was only here due to necessity, and had information regarding the Jackal-man.
            The thieves name was <a href="characters.html#kaivo" class="clean">Kaivo</a>, and she joined the party to assist in their quests, provided she would get to visit her father again.
            Many adventures happened with this group, there was a trip to Alvaldi which resulted in a masked group conducting a large scale attack on the city, a curse that had afflicted one of the party members, and a mysterious disappearance of magic happening in the neighboring city of Brontes.
            Throughout everything, the group had stayed together, that was until <a href="characters.html#don" class="clean">Don</a> had decided one day to pursue his own adventures. <a href="characters.html#risiko" class="clean">Risiko</a> also decided to hang his adventuring gauntlets up after finally getting some sembelence of life back after a political overthrowing in Brontes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whilst all of this was happenning, Vlevos, who would soon turn out to be <a href="characters.html#kaivo" class="clean">Kaivo's</a> cousin, was influencing the entire city of Crius and turning it into his political haven.
            The party started tracking him down, in an attempt to figure out why he was so feverishly trying to gain control of a city.
            The party fought through everything Vlevos threw at them, including a gigantic frog and a house full of portals.
            One of these portals led them to the Wastes of Tyche, where they met a tall Tiefling by the name of <a href="characters.html#mammon" class="clean">Mammon</a>, who was able to help them get back to Crius, and in turn Vlevos.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the cities guards under his control, the party had no choice but to break into his home after causing a mass distraction.
            This led to the discovery of Vlevos turning himself into a lich with the help of Gygax, the Jackal-man figure. 
            Once he was defeated, the party members were heralded as the "Saviours of Crius", but during these celebrations the masked group showed up, raining down terror upon the city in the form of an ancient red Dragon called Budriann the Insane.
            They survived this encounter barely, within the chaos, flames and panic, a small Goblin by the name of Bucket was there to teleport them away to safety.
            After this, the party had become downbeat, not knowing what they can do against this foe. While residing in Lowestoft, they met a strange being by the name of Qilen, who told them to seek out certain "Locks of Divinity", items crafted during the time of gods.
            He told the party that these items would enable them to defeat Budriann, and save the city of Crius.
        </p>

        <h3>What are they currently doing?</h3>
        <p>
            So far, the party have ventured far and wide across the lands to collect these "Locks of Divinity", alongside this Canvas has been acquiring a collection of items dubbed the "Tiamat's Shackles", designed for taking down dragons.
            They have acquired the platina edge, a mithril blade that required <a href="characters.html#hesk" class="clean">Hesk</a> to get struck by an elder tempests lightening while holding a rusty greatsword, the eventides guard, which required <a href="characters.html#ara" class="clean">Ara</a> to visit her long destroyed home of Lunara.
            There was also the infiltrators shroud, found at the bottom of the hidden tower of Ratbone, leaving Umbra's Repose and the Cinder Core as the only two items left.
            As they collect these items they become stronger, soon they will be able to take on the scourge of Budriann the Insane, although an another encounter with the masked group (now known as the White-Breath) leads them to believe there may be a larger threat of Tiamat looming above...
