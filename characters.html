                <p>
                    The young Moon Elf, Ara grew up in a small town called Lunara, living the normal life a child should, until one day the city came under attack by a group of masked supremacists.
                    The city was obliterated within the attack, many of the residents were killed, including her parents. She only just managed to escape with her life, now she was left to live life as an orphan, lost and alone.
                    She found her way to the nearest settlement untouched by the scourge, where she was taken in as one of their own, and under the tutorage of a sensei, she would be trained in the art of survival and combat.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Ara trained not out of fear, but because she wanted to bring those who destroyed her life accountable, and to protect others from having the same experience.
                    Death, destruction, pain and suffering formed Ara's childhood, but she was not lost, she was forged by these and became a strong willed warrior that protects the innocents wherever she may be.

                <p>
                    A native of the Dragonspine, Heskan (usually called Hesk) was a proud solider of his people, his life was patrols and warfare, to which he excelled at.
                    During a rising conflict one of these islands, Hesk was called upon to defend the people as was his duty, but something overcame him during this.
                    An uncontrollable rage, something so dark that he performed heinous acts of aggression towards many innocent people. After this, he awoken in a land that had been burnt to a crisp, with very little recollection of what had happened.
                    As he pieced together the evidence, figuring out what he had done, he ran far away from his home land, feeling that he had betrayed his people.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Hesk spent a long time running, but is now ready to confront himself, his dark past doesn't define him, he was once a proud warrior of the people and that is what he intends to be.
                    He aims to take the path of elightenment, become a figure that those around him can come to for aid, and purge this dark history from within himself.

                <p>
                    A member of the proud Yllaeris nobility, Kaivo was destined to have a life of luxury, until her cousin discovered a trait of which only the fathers side had.
                    A terrible curse pagued the family of Yllaeris, but the fathers bloodline was untouched by it, enabling them to live happily. Many of the household were outraged by this, and dismantled Kaivo's family, seperating her from her parents at a young age.
                    She never understood why this had happened, but she was destined to find her father again, as the last family member she could truly rely on.

                <p>
                    Through grit and determination, she would eventually find her way into the city of Crius, where she made a living as a petty thief, until she stole from one <a href="#hesk" class="clean">Heskan Norixius</a>.
                    This was when she decided to work together with the group of adventurers, although her goals were purely her own: to see her father again.

                <h3 id="canvas" class="center">'Fresh' Canvas</h3>
                <p>
                    The Tabaxi, hailing from the far reaches of <a href="thestory.html#nirah" class="clean">Nirah</a>, he lived happily with his family as a young adult. He would regularly go sailing with his crew, under the guidance of mentor Springwinds.
                    During one of these adventures of the seas, they were attacked by a fierce mage. The crew were thrown into hell and back, taking damage to each part of the ship, leaving it almost sunk.
                    As Canvas awoke from conciousness, he washed up on the shores of <a href="thestory.html#fafnir" class="clean">Fafnir</a>, wielding what appeared to be Springwinds' bow. Upon turning around he realised that his mentor had fallen, and he had given him the bow as a gift to remember him by.
                </p>    
                <p>
                    Now filled with a vengence, Canvas wishes to execute the mage who did this to him, for the honour of his mentor. He navigated his way into the city of Crius, to which he took up the profession of a trader to gain enough money to travel back to <a href="thestory.html#nirah" class="clean">Nirah</a>.
                    After selling a potion to <a href="#don" class="clean">Don Lampino La Carmona</a>, that was indeed a scam, he ended up finding the perfect group with which he could make a start towards his tale of revenge.

                <p>
                    Not much is known about Mammon, the Tiefling warlock who was found living in a cave at the Wastes of Tyche.
                    What is known about him is the fact he is being followed by a group of mages, who need him to do... something.
                    Yep, not entirely sure about many other details.

        <h4 id="don">Don Lampino La Carmona</h4>
        <p>
            A member of house Carmona, from the city of Alvaldi, Don was a noble knight of the realm, although that was actually heresay.
            In reality we never learned what Don's actual role was, before we had chance to learn he left the party for new adventures.
            During one of the parties many encounters, Don's sword was recovered, symbolising his death in combat, although we don't know for sure...
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4 id="risiko">Risiko</h4>
        <p>
            The Tiefling bard with a charismatic aura, Risiko was one of the first members of this story, meeting with <a href="#hesk" class="clean">Hesk</a> in the tavern of Eelry.
            He lived in the city of Brontes, that was until a tyrant by the name of Armand Fieschspear took over the city, segregating tieflings and other races as second class citizens.
            Risiko was forced into a life of labour, having very little to live for. He escaped that wretched place and saught to begin a new life, which led him to Eelry.
            Eventually his path would lead him back to Brontes, which was now under the control of his childhood friend, who had returned order to the city.
            After a brief encounter with Armand once again, which Risiko gladly handled, the party was awarded a mansion house to live in whenever they are in town.
            All of this adventuring had become too much for the bard, and so he decided to stay within the city of Brontes, living out a life he had once dreamt of.
